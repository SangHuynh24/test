Terms explain:
- A commit is a record of what files you have changed since the last time you made a commit. 
- 

Use git.bash terminal for Windows:

Step 1: Create a local git repository

#Check current working directory:
$ pwd

#Change directory:
$ cd ~/Desktop

# Create new folder:

$ mkdir myproject

# To initialize a git repository:
$ git init

Step 2: Add a new file to the repo

#Check the list of file in folder:
$ls

#Create a new file sang.txt:
$touch sang.txt

Step 3: Add a new file to the staging environment:
# Check which files git knows exist:
$git status

"Hey, we noticed you created a new file called mnelson.txt
, but unless you use the 'git add' command we aren't going to do anything with it."

# Add a new file to the staging environment:
$git add <filename>

Step 4: Create a commit

$git commit -m "This is my first commit!"


Step 5: Create a new branch

Say you want to make a new feature but are worried about 
making changes to the main project while developing the feature. This is where git branches come in. 

# Create new branch
$git checkout -b <my branch name>

# To check the available branch in the git:
$git branch


Step 6: Create a new repository on Github
If you only want to keep track of your code locally, you don't need to use GitHub.
But if you want to work with a team, you can use GitHub to collaboratively modify the project's code.

To create a new repo on GitHub, log in and go to the GitHub home page. 
You should see a green '+ New repository' button:
